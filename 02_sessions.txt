% Getting started

* apt install tmux

* Typing the `tmux` command will spawn a tmux server and automatically attach to a new session

    ~ tmux ls ~
    ~ tmux a -t <ID/NAME> ~

* Within a session, you now have the access to the tmux ~prefix~ key which defaults to ~ctrl + b~

* You can attach and detach from sessions without disrupting running applications

    ~ <prefix> + d~

* Cycle through sessions with ~<prefix> + (~ or ~<prefix> + )~

* If you need help you can always press: ~<prefix> + ?~
